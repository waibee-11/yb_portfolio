## My Portfolio

I am Yash Harshal Barve. I'm 21 and I am an Indian. This is my personal website. On this website you will find,
- Some of my best projects,
- My work experience,
- My education and the courses I have taken / will be taking,

I will update this website regularly as I keep exploring new technologies and keep making cool projects.

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.
